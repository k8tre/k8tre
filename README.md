[![Test](https://github.com/k8tre/k8tre/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/k8tre/k8tre/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Welcome to K8TRE! 

This is part of a DARE-UK funded project to build a community around an open-source, SATRE-compliant TRE on Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

K8TRE now supports DevContainer for easy development environment setup:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
2. Clone this repository and open it in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette (F1) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and initialize

See [DevContainer documentation](docs/development/devcontainer.md) for more details.
