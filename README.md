Welcome to K8TRE! 

This is part of a DARE-UK funded project to build a community around an open-source, SATRE-compliant TRE on Kubernetes.

Visit https://docs.k8tre.org/ for the latest documentation.

This work is pre-alpha and highly unstable. We are looking for community contributions to accelerate development.
