  spec: PVCs from K8TRE components or applications should request from a set of pre-defined storage classes, not simply from the default storage class.

{{ spec_content(page.meta) }}

## Motivation

The development of K8TRE-compliant components (e.g. apps) will be facilitated by the availability of storage in the deployment whose quality-of-service, backup policies and access modes (for example) are encoded in terms of standard Kubernetes abstractions. This will allow deployers to  match up and verify component requirements against available storage.

## Implementation Compliance

### K8TRE Reference Implementation

K8TRE uses [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) for highly available, Kubernetes-native, distributed block storage.

### TREu

### FRIDGE

FRIDGE uses Longhorn for compatibility across different HPC platforms. FRIDGE also applies encryption on storage volumes attached to Kubernetes Pods where user jobs are exectuded, ensuring data safety.

## FAQ

- Which storage requirements shall the K8TRE Specification assume the underlying Kubernetes platform will provide? e.g. what storageClass definitions / providers should be recommended/mandated?

- Which Persistent Volume Types/plugins will K8TRE Reference Implementation use?

    Storage classes should be defined for any K8TRE to use.
