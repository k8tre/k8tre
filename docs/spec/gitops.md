**Questions**: 

1. Why is employing GitOps practices recommended?

    Using GitOps confers several advantages, but it is primarily recommended to ensure deployments are auditable. Using GitOps ensures deployments (infrastructure, applications, and configuration) are stored as declarative and version-controlled code. The Git history becomes a complete log of the TRE's state, which can help operators satisfy compliance and security requirements e.g. those of ISO 27001.
