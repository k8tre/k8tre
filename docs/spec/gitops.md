## Implementation Compliance

### K8TRE Reference Implementation

uses ArgoCD installed on a management cluster to manage nearly all resources on the child cluster(s) it manages. Here "nearly all" means ArgoCD will not be responsible for creating/destroying workspaces. JupyterHub is responsible for creating/destroying workspaces.

### UCL ARC TRE

uses GitOps to provision all TRE resources, as well as all infrastructure level resources, to both staging and production environments.

### FRIDGE

## FAQ

- Why is employing GitOps practices recommended?

   Using GitOps confers several advantages, but it is primarily recommended to ensure deployments are auditable. Using GitOps ensures deployments (infrastructure, applications, and configuration) are stored as declarative and version-controlled code. The Git history becomes a complete log of the TRE's state, which can help operators satisfy compliance and security requirements e.g. those of ISO 27001.
