  spec: A TRE that deploys DNS records to allow external consumers to discover services should manage the external DNS entities together with the lifecycle operations of the corresponding services, such as deployments or upgrades. This includes removing DNS records which are no longer needed.

**Questions**: 

1. **What will provide in-cluster DNS?**

    The default CoreDNS will be suitable for most TRE implementers, since it allows access to services by servicename.namespace without a separate DNS server. A TRE implementer may use a different DNS implementation if it is necessary.
