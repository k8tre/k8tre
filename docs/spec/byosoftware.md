  spec: K8TRE supports both "bring-your-own" software and code curated software models, but it should be up to the TRE administrators to determine what can be run.

## BYO Software 

*Questions*: 
1. What is K8TRE's stance on allowing researchers to ingress "bring-your-own software" and code, versus a curated software model? Will it allow both?

    1. If it's software that runs inside the researcher's VM/workspace, it should be up to the TRE administrators to determine what can be run. If it's software that requires additional infrastructure, then this is a different question regarding compliant interfaces and prerequisites for arbitrary infrastructure interacting with a K8TRE instance.
