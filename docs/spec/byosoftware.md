## Implementation Compliance

### K8TRE Reference Implementation

The K8TRE Reference Implementation will be agnostic to whether a deployment supports "bring-your-own software and code" versus curated software, and will be offered with both options available via deployment configuration. It will include some example open-source applications, but expects deployments to use their own container images.

### TREu

TREu is designed for a bring-your-own software model, encouraging researchers to create Docker containers outside the TRE with required software tools, then ingress the container images into the TRE through the airlock. Pre-fabricated images are also made available to Projects via configured "global resources" (akin to a package manager).

### FRIDGE

FRIDGE extends the computational capability of another TRE by accepting tasks to run on the HPC platform where FRIDGE is deployed. Although adopting a job submission model, FRIDGE allows users to upload container images with their own software that is to be executed as a job.

## FAQ

- **What is K8TRE's stance on allowing researchers to ingress "bring-your-own software and code", versus a curated software model? Will it allow both?**

   If it's software that runs inside the researcher's VM/workspace, it should be up to the TRE administrators to determine what can be run. If it's software that requires additional infrastructure, then this is a different question regarding compliant interfaces and prerequisites for arbitrary infrastructure interacting with a K8TRE instance.
