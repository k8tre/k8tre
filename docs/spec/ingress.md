## Implementation Compliance

### K8TRE Reference Implementation

currently implements an NGINX Ingress Controller 

### UCL ARC TRE

implements an NGINX Ingress Controller exposed to a AWS Network Load Balancer. Cloudflare is the only public origin allowed, ensuring no requests go to the NLB directly.

### FRIDGE

## FAQ

- **Are load balancers mandatory for a K8TRE?**

    No - the use of an external (i.e. off-cluster) load balancer is recommended, but not mandatory unless you're using services of type `LoadBalancer`.

- **Should one LB per app be discouraged on account of costs i.e. should K8TRE encourage use of ingress controller + services for load balancing?**

    If one load balancer can be used to support multiple applications (e.g. AWS ALB), then this is encouraged to reduce potentially high cloud costs.
