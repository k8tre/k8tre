k8tre_statements:
  spec: All external access to applications/services must be via the ingress/gateway. The TREs must use a network plugin/CNI that fully supports Network Policy enforcement.

**Questions**: 

1. **What capabilities must a CNI must provide the cluster to be K8TRE compliant?**

    Full support for K8S Network Policies? i.e. not AWS VPC CNI or Azure CNI..?

2. **Should applications/services outside the cluster also have access to the CIDR/VPC/VNET**

    No. A K8TRE's CIDR/VPC/VNET is solely for in-cluster use only so all external access is via the ingress/gateway.
